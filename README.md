The Battleship Game

This repository contains the code for a web-based implementation of the classic game Battleship. The game can be played on a live preview available at https://saurabhje.github.io/the-battleship/. The implementation is done using JavaScript and features a user interface where players can interact by clicking on the game board to attack and deploy their ships. The opponent in the game is the computer, which makes automated moves based on its own set of rules and intelligence to plan attacks on the player's game board.
How to Play -

    1. Open the live preview of the game in your web browser by visiting https://saurabhje.github.io/the-battleship/.

    2. The game interface will be displayed, showing the player's game board and the opponent's game board.

    3. To deploy your ships, click on the player's game board cells to place the ships horizontally.

    4. Once all the ships are deployed, the game will begin, and it will be the opponent's turn to attack first.

    5. The opponent's moves will be automated, and you can see the result of their attack on your game board.

    6. To attack the opponent's game board, click on the opponent's cells to make your move.

    7. If the cell color changes to green, it indicates a miss, and if it changes to red, it indicates a hit.

    8. Continue taking turns with the opponent, attacking and defending until one player's ships are all sunk.

    9. The game will provide feedback and declare the winner at the end.

Game Rules

   * Ships can only be placed horizontally on the player's game board.

    The following ships are available to deploy:
    1. Carrier (5 cells)
    2. Submarine (4 cells)
    3. Destroyer (3 cells)
    4. Ship (2 cells)

    The opponent's moves are automated and based on its own set of rules and intelligence to strategically plan attacks on the player's game board.

    The game continues until all ships of one player are sunk. The player whose ships are all sunk will lose the game.
